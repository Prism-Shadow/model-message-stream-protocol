## What changed

- `minimax_m3` no longer reads the argument deltas. Each tool call is read from the
  `function_call` item of the `response.output_item.done` event — `call_id`, `name` and
  `arguments` — and delivered at that point the way the Gemini clients deliver theirs: one
  `partial_tool_call` carrying the whole arguments, then the complete `tool_call`;
  `response.output_item.added`, `response.function_call_arguments.delta` and
  `response.function_call_arguments.done` are ignored. The one fragment and the complete call
  carry the same arguments, so they can never disagree.
- The completed item's `arguments` go through the `ToolCallArgumentParseError` check:
  malformed, truncated or non-object JSON raises with the client, tool name and call id
  attached, instead of yielding a `tool_call`.
- `MiniMax-M3` joined the tool-call-arguments cases in both languages, and the Responses fake
  streams carry the `response.output_item.done` item a server sends once a call's arguments are
  done. The combine case now also checks, on every client, that the fragments announce the call
  before the complete item and concatenate to the arguments it carries.
- The dev skill and the data-models references record `minimax_m3` as the one client that
  delivers the completed item instead of streaming on deltas.
