## response.output_item.added

Emitted when a new output item is added.

### Fields

- `item: ResponseOutputItem`

  The output item that was added. For reasoning items, `encrypted_content` may be incomplete while
  the item is in progress. Use the reasoning item from the corresponding
  `response.output_item.done` event when passing it as input to a subsequent request.

- `output_index: number`

  The index of the output item that was added.

- `sequence_number: number`

  The sequence number of this event.

- `type: union`

  The type of the event. Always `response.output_item.added`.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "response.output_item.added",
  "output_index": 0,
  "item": {
    "id": "msg_123",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "type": "message",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": []
  },
  "sequence_number": 1
}
```

### `reasoning` output item (union variant of `ResponseOutputItem`)

A description of the chain of thought used by a reasoning model while generating a response.
Be sure to include these items in your `input` to the Responses API for subsequent turns of a
conversation if you are manually [managing context](/api/docs/guides/conversation-state).

- `id: string`

  The unique identifier of the reasoning content.

- `summary: array`

  Reasoning summary content.

- `type: union`

  The type of the object. Always `reasoning`.

- `content: optional array`

  Reasoning text content.

- `encrypted_content: optional string`

  The encrypted content of the reasoning item. This is populated by default for reasoning items
  returned by `POST /v1/responses` and WebSocket `response.create` requests.

  When streaming, use the completed reasoning item and its `encrypted_content` from the
  `response.output_item.done` event in subsequent requests. The `encrypted_content` in
  `response.output_item.added` may be incomplete. This is especially important when `store` is
  `false` or when using Zero Data Retention.

- `status: optional union`

  The status of the item. One of `in_progress`, `completed`, or `incomplete`. Populated when items
  are returned via API.

## response.output_item.done

Emitted when an output item is marked done.

### Fields

- `item: ResponseOutputItem`

  The output item that was marked done.

- `output_index: number`

  The index of the output item that was marked done.

- `sequence_number: number`

  The sequence number of this event.

- `type: union`

  The type of the event. Always `response.output_item.done`.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "response.output_item.done",
  "output_index": 0,
  "item": {
    "id": "msg_123",

Every night, she would leave sparkling, magical flowers by the water's edge, hoping to share her beauty with others. One enchanting evening, she woke to find a group of friendly animals gathered around, eager to be friends and share in her magic.",

## Response object fields read by the terminal events

The `response` payload of `response.completed`, `response.incomplete` and `response.failed`
is the full Response object. Only the fields the clients read are kept here.

- `error: ResponseError`

  An error object returned when the model fails to generate a Response.

- `incomplete_details: object`

  Details about why the response is incomplete.

- `model: ResponsesModel`

  Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-6-astra`. OpenAI offers a wide range of models
  with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the [model
  guide](/api/docs/models) to browse and compare available models.

- `service_tier: optional ServiceTier`

  Specifies the processing type used for serving the request. - If set to 'auto', then the request
  will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise
  configured, the Project will use 'default'. - If set to 'default', then the request will be
  processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model. - If set to
  '[flex](/api/docs/guides/flex-processing)', then the request will be processed with the Flex
  Processing service tier. - To opt-in to [Fast mode](/api/docs/guides/fast-mode) at the request
  level, include the `service_tier=fast` or `service_tier=priority` parameter for Responses or
  Chat Completions. The response will show `service_tier=priority` regardless of if you specify
  `service_tier=fast` or `priority` in your request. - If set to 'ultrafast', then the request
  will be processed with the access-controlled Ultrafast Processing service tier. This tier is
  currently available for `gpt-5.6-sol`; a response served through it will show
  `service_tier=ultrafast`. - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

  When the `service_tier` parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
  value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may
  be different from the value set in the parameter.

- `status: optional ResponseStatus`

  The status of the response generation. One of `completed`, `failed`, `in_progress`, `cancelled`,
  `queued`, or `incomplete`.

- `usage: optional ResponseUsage`

  Represents token usage details including input tokens, output tokens, a breakdown of output
  tokens, and the total tokens used.

## Usage object

Represents token usage details including input tokens, output tokens, a breakdown of output
tokens, and the total tokens used.

- `input_tokens: number`

  The number of input tokens.

- `input_tokens_details: object`

  A detailed breakdown of the input tokens.

- `output_tokens: number`

  The number of output tokens.

- `output_tokens_details: object`

  A detailed breakdown of the output tokens.

- `total_tokens: number`

  The total number of tokens used.

### `usage.input_tokens_details`

- `cache_write_tokens: number`

  The number of input tokens that were written to the cache.

- `cached_tokens: number`

  The number of tokens that were retrieved from the cache. [More on prompt
  caching](/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching).

### `usage.output_tokens_details`

- `reasoning_tokens: number`

  The number of reasoning tokens.
